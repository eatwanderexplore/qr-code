## My process

This challenge provided mockups of what the final project should look like. I started by updating my information into the links and text, then worked on building the container for the qr-code image. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was challenging to get the container to center vertically as well as horizontally. When I searched for a way to do it, I found that it is a common challenge – getting an element to do one or the other is easy, but a lot more challenging to do both.

The solution I found on the freeCodeCamp website actually made the element jump to the top of the page and made the top half of the element not visible. I had to change the values to positive instead of negative and it moved to the center vertically as hoped.
